<h1> Pong </h1>
<h3>First approach to videogames by developing a mighty Pong</h3>

The idea of developing this is making some respect to history of video games and also the inspiration 
from this video from <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmB4ohLDFAWm2QX-h5uM_3g">BMo</a></strong>, who I came across with while starting to learn Unity and C#:

After some development and playing around, I've found another YouTube playlist from <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC49ACIHmz1yvHqdDE4Y_foQ">L_Daven</a></strong> (in Spanish) which develops the game in an approach which I liked most, so I've redone the game and played around with it.
